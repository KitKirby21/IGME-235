                <p>
                    My name is Kirby Saligo, and I love video games. In particular, my favorite video games are Hollow
                    Knight and X-Com, though I play games of nearly every genre. The only thing a game needs to achieve
                    to be worth playing for me is to be fun in its own way. My goal is to become a game designer after
                    graduation and make my own games because I love thinking of and experimenting with game mechanics
                    and figuring out balancing, what would make it more fun and how all the pieces of a game work
                    together to make the experience. In general, all parts of my time at RIT is geared towards that goal, 
                    with the minor exceptions of my Japanese immersion and my ballroom club activities, which serve as my 
                    leisure time here.
