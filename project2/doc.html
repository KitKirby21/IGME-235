    <h1>Plan</h1>
    <p>
        I plan on creating an improved gif finder site using the GIPHY API once again. This is intended for those
        that want to find gifs from GIPHY, and I intend on adding the functionality of keeping recent searches,
        favoriting gifs to return to, and the ability to copy the URL of a favorited gif to their clipboard with a
        button.
    </p>

    <h2>Mobile Layout</h2>
    <img src="images/sketch.png" alt="Mockup">

    <h2>Special Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking gifs will favorite them</li>
        <li>Clicking favorited gifs or the same gif from search results will unfavorite them</li>
        <li>When restarting the site, it saves the last search in local storage and keeps it in the search field for
            next time</li>
        <li>There is a loading bar with a purple bar cycling around a gray wheel but it typically finds results too
            quickly to see for long</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Self Grade</h3>
    <p>
        I would probably give myself an 85-90 at most. this is mainly due to the fact that despite feeling like I have
        added quite a bit of functionality to the system through favorites, local storage of previous search terms, the
        loading bar, and the changed layout, I feel like it is still quite similar to the previous gif finder in some
        way despite having different nearly everything except for main function. As I am not the best designer, I also
        wouldn't give the design that high of a score, hence 85-90.
