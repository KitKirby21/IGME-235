    <h1>Game Name by Kirby Saligo</h1>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>It's the snake game, except you're in space and trying to eat something too big for you will kill you just as
        much as running into yourself!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>It's hard to put a genre on the snake game but the closest I can think of would be an avoidance growth simulation
        I guess.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop only</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>This is generally abstract; with the basic premise of a snake that wants to grow BEEG and eats increasingly
        larger celestial objects in order to achieve this.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>This would be a relatively cartoonish graphic, with maybe a looped noise and a crunch sound effect with
        everything eaten.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The main game mechanic would be changing the direction of the heading of the snake in order to avoid obstacles or
        acquire sustenance.</p>

    <h2>About the developer</h2>
    <p>My name is Kirby, and I'm in the Game Design and Development major. My main skill set is programming and my
        biggest interest in game design is the work that goes into designing fun mechanics and how to balance them.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>My process for this project was small little goals each day. For example, the first day one of my goals was to
        set up the movement of the singular snake head. The day after, I fixed bugs in its movement such as it being
        able to go backwards when it should just be able to turn. After that, I implemented food and the ability to grow
        in length, followed by the ability to die and restart. Only after the game was fully functional did I add
        auxiliary parts such as a game screen, a score tracker, and high score local storage. </p>

    <h2>Anything Special</h2>
    <p>The most special things that I did for this project was creating changing the way that food appears between six
        different images through java script. Aside from that, I also implemented a local storage for the high score. In
        terms of project requirements, I met the requirements by having it be an easy simple Snake game. The window
        adjusts to the screen size of the user, and images are stored properly. All HTML/CSS is valid, and I use an ES6
        class within the code which is commented well.
