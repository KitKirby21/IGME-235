    <h1>Game Name by Kirby Saligo</h1>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>It's the snake game, except you're in space and trying to eat something too big for you will kill you just as
        much as running into yourself!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Genre</h2>
    <p>It's hard to put a genre on the snake game but the closest I can think of would be an avoidance growth simulation
        I guess.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <p>Desktop only</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>This is generally abstract; with the basic premise of a snake that wants to grow BEEG and eats increasingly
        larger celestial objects in order to achieve this.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>This would be a relatively cartoonish graphic, with maybe a looped noise and a crunch sound effect with
        everything eaten.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The main game mechanic would be changing the direction of the heading of the snake in order to avoid obstacles or
        acquire sustenance.</p>

    <h2>About the developer</h2>
    <p>My name is Kirby, and I'm in the Game Design and Development major. My main skill set is programming and my
        biggest interest in game design is the work that goes into designing fun mechanics and how to balance them.</p>
