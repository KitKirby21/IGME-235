            This will be a personal portfolio. I plan on making each 'option' in this page a link, each going to any of
            my 3 best projects at the moment with a short description underneath, and then a general content paragraph
            about myself beneath it all. I also am considering making a modification with an additional section above
            the initial 3 options in for an image of myself and maybe a github link should I have one with sufficient
            content that I want to show off.
