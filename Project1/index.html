            <p id="main-paragraph">
                My name is Kirby Saligo, and I love video games. In particular, my favorite video games are Hollow
                Knight and X-Com, though I play games of nearly every genre. The only thing a game needs to achieve to
                be worth playing for me is to be fun in its own way. My goal is to become a game designer after
                graduation
                making or design games. I love thinking of and experimenting with game mechanics and figuring out
                balancing, what would make it more fun and how all the pieces of a game work together to make the
                experience. In general, all parts of my time at RIT is geared towards that goal, with the minor
                exceptions of my
                Japanese immersion and my ballroom club activities, which serve as my leisure time here.

                    <p>This 2D Shooter is a spaceship simulator made in Unity where the player is given the ability to
                        pilot a ship against waves of enemies, levelling up over time with increasingly powerful stats
                        against progressively stronger enemies.

                        system that allows the player to control the height of their jump based on how long they hold

                        This attempt was successful and even includes a high score system and randomly generated 'food'
                        pieces.</p>
