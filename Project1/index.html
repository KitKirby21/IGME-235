            <p id="main-paragraph">
                My name is Kirby Saligo, and I love video games. In particular, my favorite video games are Hollow
                Knight
                and X-Com, though I play games of nearly every genre. The only thing a game needs to achieve to be worth
                playing for me is to be fun in its own way. My goal is to become a game designer after graduation and
                make
                my own games because I love thinking of and experimenting with game mechanics and figuring out
                balancing,
                what would make it more fun and how all the pieces of a game work together to make the experience. In
                general, all parts of my time at RIT is geared towards that goal, with the minor exceptions of my
                Japanese
                immersion and my ballroom club activities, which serve as my leisure time here.

                    <p>The Shoot 'Em Up project is a 2D spaceship simulator where the player is given the ability to

                        ship against waves of enemies, levelling up over time with increasingly powerful stats.</p>
